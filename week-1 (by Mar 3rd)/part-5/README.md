# Week 1 Part 5

## Assignment

### Step 1: Get Marketing Campaigns

The carousel section, located at the top of the home page, is for marketing campaigns. Although there are multiple marketing campaigns running simultaneously, we only display one at a time.

Connect to the [Marketing Campaign API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Stylish#marketing-campaigns-api) using AJAX to obtain the links, stories, and image paths.

Dynamically build the carousel section.

When a user clicks on one of the campaigns, redirect them to the corresponding link.

### Step 2: Slide Effect

Complete the slide effect to showcase different campaigns to customers in the carousel section.

1. Automatically change to the next slide every 5 seconds.
2. Change to the corresponding slide when users click on a dot.
3. (Optional) Stop the timer when a user hovers over the banner.
4. (Optional) Restart the timer when the user's cursor moves away from the dot.
