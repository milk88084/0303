### Step 1: Retrieve the Parameter from Page URL

#### Description

Any link to the product page should accept an `id` parameter for a specific product detail.

### Step 2: Connect to the Product Details API

Having retrieved the id from the URL, now connect to the [Product Details API](https://github.com/AppWorks-School-Materials/API-Doc/tree/master/Stylish#product-details-api) to obtain the data for the product details.

### Step 3: Render Product Details on the Product Page
